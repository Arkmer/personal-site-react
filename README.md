# Goals
- [x] Multiple pages
- [ ] Current page link is highlighted
- [ ] Template for project cards
- [ ] Template for resume pieces

## Ideas
### Highlight Current Link:
- Look for a way to find the current URL? Use it as the identifier.
- Currently set up to on click pass page name into function. How do I use it? How do I handle page reloads?

### Template for Projects
- Rows of 3-5?
- Vertical cards, pic of something relevant, some basic info: purpose, languages/libraries, link to Github, link to working project

### Resume Template
- Template for sections
- Side bar? Careful it doesn't cover the nav bar.
